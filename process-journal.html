                <p>After our group decided on a problem space of international airports, we seperately conducted our own research and different research methods to find true problem areas that arise during a passangers visit to an international airport. </p>
                <h5 class = "subtitle">How?</h5>
                <p>I went onsite to The Sydney International Airport and conducted <strong> nine </strong> semi-structured interviews and <strong> three </strong> think aloud sessions. After conducting my part of the primary research, I discovered four main problem areas: wayfinding, checking in, baggage and post check in experience</p>

                  <p>After conducting my initial interviews and think aloud sessions, I created personas and from those personas I generated an user journey map outlining the average journey a user would partake throughout their experience to an airport. <br />As you can see from the diagram pictured, arriving at the airport is a high, positive point for the users, as they are excited for their impending journey. However, as they start the process of checking in, the user becomes flustered and anxious. The users experience becomes even more negative when they have to ask for staff asistance. The overall experience only starts to become positive again when they are getting ready to board.</p>

                <p>After my group each conducted seperate initial research, we joined to analyse our data and start the process of coming up with a solution. First we decided to narrow down our focus to three main problem areas. On advice from our tutor we came up with an <strong>How Might We</strong>  statement for each problem area. Whilst creating the statements, we realised that the two problems of wayfinding and notifications were heavily intertwined. So we came up with an additional statement also.</p>

This concept addresses the concern that the user had of security. Use the carousel below to view the storyboard, screen sketches and a paper prototype.  </p>

                <p>Unfortunetly, this concept had a lot of downfalls. After consulting with our tutor and testing this with a number of users, we discovered that whilst the aim was to improve the security concerns of the issue, it actually caused more problems. Passangers had trust issues not knowing where their belongings or checked baggage was going and if it was going to the correct location. The face scanning concept could also cause security issues. Another issue we had was the autonomous aspect of the design. It wasnt the main feature, therefore didnt adhere to the brief.</p>

              <p>After consulting with out tutor, our group decided that we wanted to merge the two concepts into one to create a more elevated idea. Decisions that were improved included:
                <ul>
                  <li> No need for the "motherbot" anymore </li>
                  <li> Eliminated motion sensor </li>
                  <li> Eliminated face scanning as it posed security issues. boarding pass was suggested instead</li>
                  <li> Eliminated voice command, as the noise of the airport would conflict with the voice of the user</li>
                  <li> Eliminated the option to pick if travelling solo or in a group as our user testing proved that we didnt need this feature.</li>
                  <li> Changed the search process for additional activities to make the user flow more organic</li>
                  <li> Eliminated cash and paypal as paying by card was the only feasible option</li>
                  <li> Added a tracking buzzer that allows Friendbot to locate the user when the bot collects shopping and food. </li>
                  <li> Changed the process of payment so the user pays before the food was delivered to stop theft and wastage </li>

            <p>naviGATE is an autonomous pod that travels from the security exit to all ends of the airport to deliver passengers to their gates in a safe and timely fashion.

        <p>Our group really liked this concept, however after conducting very basic initial user testing and consulting with our tutor we decided to make the following changes:
          <ul>
            <li> Make the pods personalised, so one pod per travel group.</li>
            <li> Make the pods smaller so they can navigate the airport quicker.</li>
            <li> Travellers only have the option to travel to their gate unless there is a delay. This would improve time optimisation.</li>

        <h5 class = "subtitle">User Testing Paper Prototypes</h5>
        <p>After considerations, we decided to go ahead with two out of our three concepts. We chose <strong>Friendbot</strong> and <strong>naviGATE.</strong> We user tested both of the paper prototypes with a variety of methods. We utalised <strong>think aloud</strong>, <strong>observations</strong> and <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong> to fully gauge our users response. In total we tested 16 users. We chose users who have travelled overseas often and have been to both foreign and local airports.</p>

              <p>Using Sketch and invision, we created interactive wireframes so that we could do another round of user testing before we make our final interactive prototype. Because our concept has a lot of screens and a lot of different situations that could happen, we decided to split our testing into two different scenarios, as this made it easier to get more input from our users. The first scenario had the user get to their gate by going through the check-in process and then they had to order food. The second scenario involved the user watching a movie on the robot.</p>

                  <p>After user testing our wireframes, we created an initial round of interactive mockups on Framer X. We had alot of issues on Framer X that resulted in our process becoming slower. Framer X was very slow and unresponsive once our number of screens increased dramatically. We also had trouble sharing our screens so we could user test and even tually submit. For the user testing we had to just use my laptop. We really wanted to use an Ipad so the user would get a feel for the screen size, but as mentioned, the sharing capabilites on Framer X were poor. We user tested the screens on users from a wide age group, all frequent travellers. Because we did alot of iteration and ideation in our paper prototyping stage, the issues we came across when testing this time were few and far between. The main issues we had included:
                    <ul>
                      <li> The alert for gate and boarding time changes wasnt effective. We changed this so the notification pops up automatically. </li>
                      <li> There wasn't a back button. Users wanted a way to go back but they didnt really like the idea of a back button. We implemented a swipe feature where the user swipes to go bsck a screen just like on a smartphone. We also included a tutorial on how to do this on the very first screen.</li>
